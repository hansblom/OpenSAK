## [1.4.0] — 2026
### Added
- **Trip Planner** (`Ctrl+T`) — new dialog to plan a geocaching trip:
  - **Radius tab** — select caches within a set distance from the active home point; sort by distance, difficulty, terrain, date or name
  - **Route tab (A→B→…)** — find caches along a multi-point route (up to 10 waypoints); caches sorted in driving order along the route
  - Route points can be typed in any coordinate format (DMM, DMS, DD) with live validation, or picked directly from saved home points
  - Route points can be reordered with ▲/▼ buttons or drag-and-drop
  - Common filters: max cache count, not-found only, available only
  - **🗺️ Show on map** — opens a non-blocking map popup showing selected caches on an interactive OSM map
  - Export selected caches directly to GPS device or GPX file
- **Home points list** — replace single home coordinate with a named list (e.g. Home, Cottage, Hotel):
  - Add, edit, activate and delete points from Settings
  - Accepts any coordinate format (DMM, DMS, DD) with live validation; displays in your chosen format
  - Active point marked with ★ in the list
  - **Quick-switch dropdown** in the toolbar — switch active home point instantly without opening Settings
  - Distance column and trip planner update immediately when home point changes

### Fixed
- Settings menu renamed from "Tools" / "Funktioner" to "Settings" / "Indstillinger" to avoid duplicate "Tools" entry in menu bar
